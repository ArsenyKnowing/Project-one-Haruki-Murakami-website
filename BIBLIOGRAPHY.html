          Most of Haruki Murakami's works use first-person narrative in the
          tradition of the Japanese I-novel. He states that because family plays
          a significant role in traditional Japanese literature, any main
          character who is independent becomes a man who values freedom and
          solitude over intimacy. Also notable is Murakami's unique humor, as
          seen in his 2000 short story collection, After the Quake. In the story
          "Superfrog Saves Tokyo", the protagonist is confronted with a 6-foot
          tall frog that talks about the destruction of Tokyo over a cup of tea.
          In spite of the story's sober tone, Murakami feels the reader should
          be entertained once the seriousness of a subject has been broached.
          Another notable feature of Murakami's stories are the comments that
          come from the main characters as to how strange the story presents
          itself. Murakami explains that his characters experience what he
          experiences as he writes, which could be compared to a movie set where
          the walls and props are all fake. He has further compared the process
          of writing to movies: "That is one of the joys of writing fiction—I'm
          making my own film made just for myself."

              Haruki Murakami needs no further introduction. Dubbed a “literary
              genius”, his bestselling books and stories have been translated
              into more than 50 languages. With his unique brand of intelligent
              prose that straddles the line between reality and imaginary, his
              page-turners not only provoke thoughts, but also evoke emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Murakami has always been a music lover first, and author second.
              In as early as Hear The Wind Sing (1979) and A Wild Sheep Chase
              (1982), or later during his career in Kafka on the Shore (2002),
              his works are often peppered with melodious descriptions of music;
              weaving an elegant arrangement that guides the reader through
              different genres like jazz, rock, country and classical. Here, we
              explore Murakami's music, love for jazz, and how music has
              influenced his life and work.
            </p>
            <h5>MURAKAMI'S JAZZ BAR AND PRE-AUTHOR DAYS</h5>
            <p>
              Kyoto-born Murakami met his wife Yoko while studying drama at the
              prestigious Waseda University in Tokyo. Both of them shared a love
              for jazz music, juggling multiple part-time jobs and putting aside
              their hard-earned wages to realise a dream: three years later in
              1974, even before completing his studies at Waseda, Murakami and
              Yoko opened Peter Cat at the South exit of Kokubunji Station,
              Tokyo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Murakami's jazz bar by night and café by day, Peter Cat was a
              culmination of everything Murakami loved, but running it was a
              challenge. In Peter Cat’s early days, they were always
              short-handed, which meant the author had to manage everything
              himself, from daily tasks like serving customers to preparing
              drinks to washing dishes; to the more music-centric roles like
              playing records to entertaining song requests to contacting
              musicians who were willing to perform at his space.
            </p>
            <p>
              “As long as it is something that I like, I will work hard and do
              it wholeheartedly.” One often imagines that being a shop owner is
              liberating, both financially and emotionally. Murakami insists
              that this is not the case – even when Peter Cat finally got its
              momentum on track, it was not a truly profitable business. In
              truth, he was often attacked with ill-meaning resentment and
              unfounded criticisms, which became even more exhausting as the
              years passed. In the end, Murakami ran his jazz bar for a total of
              seven years before finally retiring from the business.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1979, at Peter Cat’s second location in downtown Sendagaya,
              Murakami began writing his first novel, Hear the Wind Sing,
              following a burst of inspiration while watching a baseball game
              between the Yakult Swallows and the Hiroshima Carp. Working in
              brief stretches, often writing for one or two hours in the kitchen
              after closing for the night, he finally completed it after ten
              months, and proceeded to send it to Gunzo magazine, where it won
              the Gunzo Prize for New Writers.
            </p>
            <h5>MURAKAMI ON MUSIC: “THE INSPIRATION FOR MY WORK.”</h5>
            <p>
              Murakami admits that his writing style stems from his love for
              music. Even today, he almost always works while listening to
              music. “I’ve never learned how to write from anyone, nor have I
              studied in particular. So, if you ask me where I learned to write,
              my answer is music. Rather than learning a technique from someone,
              I’ve become conscious about rhythms, harmony and improvisation. If
              you think my books are easy to read, perhaps we have something in
              common musically,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a penchant for classical, jazz and rock music, Murakami often
              pays homage to his favourite songs, either incorporated into
              stories or titles. In Hear the Wind Sing, he mentions many
              distinctive tunes that complement the lazy summer setting,
              including “California Girls” by The Beach Boys and “Good Luck
              Charm” by Elvis Presley.
            </p>
            <p>
              Murakami’s clever connection with words and music continues in
              Norwegian Wood (1987), which echoes the underlying veiled meaning
              suggested in The Beatles’ “Norwegian Wood”, depicting an
              extramarital affair. In Murakami’s book, the main character
              reminisces the relationships he had with two very different women.
            </p>
            <p>
              Classical music also makes an appearance in The Wind-up Bird
              Chronicle (1997), which comprises three parts: Book of the
              Thieving Magpie, Book of the Prophesying Bird and Book of the
              Bird-Catcher Man. What makes Murakami’s books so intriguing to
              read is the existence of these “easter eggs” – whether about his
              personal preferences of music, or about the genre itself – which
              make an appearance when you least expect it.
            </p>
            <h5>MURAKAMI RADIO: CONNECTING MUSIC AND PEOPLE</h5>
            <p>
              Another interesting thing to know is that many jazz fans have also
              revealed that they became interested in the music after reading
              about it in Murakami’s books. Portrait in Jazz (1997), beautifully
              illustrated by Makoto Wada, brings together 26 jazz legends
              ranging from Billie Holiday to Chet Baker to Charlie Christian, a
              tribute to the golden age of jazz and the iconic musicians that
              became Murakami’s inspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Absolutely on Music (2011), Murakami delves into a personal
              conversation about music and writing with his close friend Seiji
              Ozawa, an internationally acclaimed conductor who formerly led the
              Boston Symphony Orchestra. Perhaps it can be said that music has
              shaped Murakami into the author he is today. Without music, he
              would not be the Murakami we know and admire.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where music has inspired Murakami; Murakami has also inspired
              music: to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Hear the Wind Sing,
              a list of the songs mentioned in the novel was released as an
              album. There are also compilations made based on the songs he
              talked about, like Murakami Haruki’s Lullaby, based on the songs
              he listens to before going to sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beginning 5 August 2018, Murakami stepped up to a new role as the
              host of his on-radio segment, Murakami Radio, on Tokyo FM. Through
              Murakami Radio, which runs for 55 minutes per session, fans and
              music lovers can hear Murakami for the first time as he talks
              about two things that have an important spot in his heart: music
              and running (he has been competing in marathons since the 1980s).
              In May of this year, a “Stay Home” special was aired for Murakami
              Radio’s 14th episode. During the show, the 71-year-old author
              played a selection of songs he hoped would keep listeners’ spirits
              up during the peak of the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s always been my hobby to collect records and CDs. Thanks to
              that, my house is filled with such things. However, I sometimes
              feel guilty towards the world while listening to such amazing
              music and having a good time alone. I thought it might be good to
              share it with other people while chatting over a glass of wine or
              a cup of coffee,” shares Murakami. For context, he owns a massive
              collection of over 10,000 LPs, which you can listen to over here,
              thanks to a Spotify user by the name of Masamaro Fujiki, who
              compiled over 230 hours of tunes based on Murakami’s music
              collection.

              Haruki Murakami (born 1949) is an award-winning Japanese writer
              and novelist. His work has been translated into over forty
              languages. His stories follow fairly normal main characters who
              experience eccentric situations, romance, and coming-of-age
              transformations. He has developed an international following and
              has garnered critical acclaim for his writing and novels. Haruki
              Murakami is internationally popular because he writes about
              universally accessible subjects such as love, loss, detective
              novels, coming-of-age stories, and cats. He has also personally
              stated that his books appeal to people who are experiencing
              confusion in their life from political and cultural upheaval.

              He spent most of his childhood in Kobe, the third-largest port
              city in Japan. Both of his parents taught Japanese literature. His
              father was drafted into the Second Sino-Japenese War and suffered
              from post-traumatic stress disorder. Murakami remembers hearing
              distressing stories from his father as a child. This would lead to
              Murakami's outspoken criticism of Japan and expressing a desire
              for accountability for past war crimes.

              When Murakami was eighteen, he moved to Tokyo, Japan's capital, to
              attend Waseda University. It was a private institution, not
              affiliated with any other schools, and was known for accepting a
              range of students. His parents wanted him to study law. However,
              Murakami chose to set his sights on studying literature and passed
              the Literature department entrance exams at Waseda.

              According to Murakami, most students skipped a lot of classes, and
              he was no exception. He did, however, meet his future wife, Yoko,
              in their first class together. He made few friends and avoided
              student groups and organizations. He spent most of his time as a
              loner going to jazz clubs. Just a few years after graduating,
              Murakami opened a coffee and jazz bar named Peter Cat with his
              wife Yoko in Tokyo from 1974 to 1981.

              Murakami began writing when he was twenty-nine. He remembers
              having a defining moment while watching a baseball game. Suddenly
              he was struck with the urge to write. Working during the day at
              Peter Cat, he would go home to write at night.

              For a stretch of nearly ten months, Haruki Murakami wrote and
              finished the manuscript of his first novel. Titled Hear the Wind
              Sing (1979), he submitted it to the only literary contest he
              believed would accept it, The Gunzo Newcomer Literary Award. He
              went on to win first prize in 1979 in the literary contest. He
              first published at age thirty.

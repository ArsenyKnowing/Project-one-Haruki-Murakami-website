            <h2>The Political Murakami on Life in a Dark Timeline</h2>
            <h4>
              Gabrielle Bellot on the Unreality of the Real World, Post-9/11
            </h4>
            <p>
              In a 2010 reflection for the New York Times on the significance of
              9/11, the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami asserted that “we are
              living in an age when reality is sufficiently unreal.” In the
              essay, Murakami divided the world into two parallel realities:
              Reality A, “the world we have now” in which 9/11 happened, and
              Reality B, “the world we might have had if 9/11 had never
              happened.” “Reality B,” he wrote, “appears to be realer and more
              rational than the world of Reality A. To put it in different
              terms, we are living a world that has an even lower level of
              reality than the unreal world. What can we possibly call this if
              not ‘chaos?’” The ripples from 9/11 across the globe, Murakami
              believed, had altered it forever, eroding open a mossy door and
              unleashing something inexplicable, something vast, irrational, and
              scary, into the waters.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an interview six years earlier with The Paris Review, he had
              said something similar, but even more unnervingly prescient of the
              reality-undermining rhetoric of Trump in 2017. “We are living,”
              Murakami said, “in a fake world; we are watching fake evening
              news. We are fighting a fake war. Our government is fake. But we
              find reality in this fake world. So our stories are the same; we
              are walking through fake scenes, but ourselves, as we walk through
              these scenes, are real.” This fakeness, he averred, figuratively
              extended to how critics outside of Asia tended to classify his
              books, in that where they saw something unreal, Asian critics
              often saw the opposite. Notably, he said, his fiction was often
              classified in the West as “magical realism.” However, reality in a
              post-9/11 world was, for him, just as magically chaotic and
              existentially absurd as the labels implied of his fiction, not
              unlike the way Mikhail Bulgakov’s breathtaking, baroque The Master
              and the Margarita—with its parade of witches, undead Russians, a
              charmingly devilish talking cat named Behemoth, and a charismatic
              Satan masquerading as a professor of the dark arts—used the
              magical to suggest how literally unreal it seemed to live under
              the terrors of Stalin’s Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Indeed, in Japan, Murakami’s fiction is often seen as Western,
              with its signature references to classical music, jazz, and
              American and European literature; in the West, however, Murakami
              is often described as representative of Japan—even, for some
              critics, that often tone-deaf term, “exotic.” (Marketing is partly
              to blame; in the West, Murakami’s covers, while attractive, often
              feature a palatable exoticism, a simple, safe, vague Otherness
              designed to draw in readers who might hesitate before more overtly
              non-Western cover imagery, thinking they won’t understand the
              latter book.) “Outside of Japan, Haruki Murakami becomes Japan, or
              at least the Japan he wants you to see,” Roland Kelts wrote in a
              profile of Murakami for The New Yorker, and it is true: there are,
              as Kelts, says, “two Murakamis.” Indeed, there are two of many
              things in Murakami’s work, including reality itself.

              “The world was terrifying long before a plane’s crash broke open a
              door to an existential underworld.”
            </h5>
            <p>
              Murakami’s work is filled with ontological binaries: parallel
              worlds, each real, and each of which, at some point, may
              intersect, like parallel train tracks of reality that, suddenly
              and jarringly, cross. In Murakami’s fiction, it’s often difficult
              to know what is true and what is not—and, sometimes, it seems
              disquietingly possible that a thing can both be and not be,
              simultaneously. This forms the core of many of his short stories,
              like “The Dancing Dwarf” and “TV People” from The Elephant
              Vanishes, and underpins his longest novel, IQ84, as well as my
              favorite of his novels, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the
              World.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps the text that best exemplifies this, however, is
              “Super-Frog Saves Tokyo,” a bizarre short story from his
              mini-collection after the quake, in which Katarigi, an
              unspectacular man from Tokyo, unceremoniously meets a six-foot
              talking frog named Frog in his home one day; Frog informs him that
              he and Katagiri must defeat an underground entity named
              Worm—literally, a gigantic worm—that will cause a cataclysmic
              earthquake if they fail to defeat him. Frog is invisible to
              everyone but Katagiri, and Katagiri later seems to hallucinate
              being shot, casting doubt on his sanity, yet Frog also pressures
              one of Katagiri’s clients, unbeknownst to Katagiri, into
              fulfilling a difficult request. No earthquake occurs. When I teach
              this story, I have my students make lists of evidence for and
              against Frog existing—and we can never, as Murakami likely
              intended, come to a definite answer. Katagiri likely hallucinated
              Frog, but Frog also has evidence in favor of his existence.
              Eerily, impossibly, both may be true: Frog doesn’t exist, yet he
              also does, in some ontological shadowland, our reality too small
              to contain him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like Murakami’s 9/11 comments, after the quake’s stories attempted
              to translate a catastrophe—the Kobe Earthquake. Perhaps Murakami’s
              lesson is that both realism and realistic fiction may be
              malleable, the latter needing to become more absurd as the former
              does to contain it. “The theme,” he told The Paris Review when
              asked about Kafka on the Shore, another novel blurring the
              realistic and the fantastical, “is this world and the other world;
              how you can come and go between them.” The surreal is the real;
              the real is surreal.
            </p>
            <p>
              He probed deeper still into this idea in an interview with the New
              York Times, where he invoked imagery straight out of Hard-Boiled
              Wonderland and the End of the World to describe both reality and
              9/11. “What I write are stories in which the hero is looking for
              the right way in this world of chaos,” Murakami said. “That is my
              theme. At the same time I think there is another world that is
              underground. You can access this inner world in your mind. Most
              protagonists in my books live in both worlds—this realistic world
              and the underground world. If you are trained you can find the
              passage and come and go between the two worlds. It is easy to find
              an entrance into this closed circuit, but it is not easy to find
              an exit. Many gurus offer an entry into the circuit for free. But
              they don’t offer a way out, because they want to keep followers
              trapped. Those people can be soldiers when they are ordered to be.
              I think that is very much like what happened with those people who
              flew the planes into those buildings.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Inexplicability enters the world in his fiction. It’s there even
              before it’s named, like an inkling—fittingly, the translated name
              of underground creatures from Japanese mythology, kappas, in
              Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. It’s almost
              everywhere, even in his less experimental novels, like Sputnik
              Sweetheart and Colourless Tsukuru. But when Murakami links this
              existential absurdity to the fanatical terrorism of 9/11, this
              inexplicability breaches not merely the real world of his fiction,
              but the real world we live in. What can that already simplistic
              term, magical realism, tell us in a world where the extraordinary
              unexpected is already now the ordinary expected?
            </p>
            <p>
              On the one hand, Murakami’s assessment is naïve. Gabriel García
              Márquez’s use of “magical realism” partly described unimaginable
              brutality—Colombia’s period of La Violencia—long before 9/11. 9/11
              was shocking; but it also was not, if viewed through a long
              historical lens. Unquestionably, it changed the world, its ripples
              of violence connected to Islamic fundamentalism buoying up
              populist movements, which all share anti-Muslim politics, by
              Trump, Marine Le Pen, Frauke Petry, and their ideological ilk; but
              it is overly simple and conservative to assume the world was truly
              more coherent before it. It is a privileged fantasy, much like
              saying the 1950s was “a better time”—quite a vacuous statement to
              someone still living under legal segregation. The world was
              terrifying long before a plane’s crash broke open a door to an
              existential underworld.

              But on the other hand, Murakami’s braiding of his fiction’s themes
              to the world his readers live in is instructive and important.
              Contrary to a common-sense view, realism is not a simple stable
              genre; as our understanding of the world changes, so do our
              definitions of realism. Life may seem to go on as it used to, if
              we were not directly impacted by a major event like 9/11, but the
              makeup of the air, the earth, the water and wind, slowly changes
              even for those furthest from a blast, just as Ray Bradbury wrote
              in a 1952 story—nearly a decade before Edward Lorenz would gain
              credit for coining the term—that the flap of a butterfly’s wings
              in one part of the world, or in one timeline, could completely
              alter another. (As James Gleick put it in Chaos: “a butterfly
              stirring the air today in Peking can transform storm systems next
              month in New York.”) I saw 9/11 on an old TV screen in Dominica; I
              didn’t understand, for years, how those images of smoking towers
              on the TV we had to run to unplug during lightning storms had
              changed me, had changed nearly everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our fiction casually adjusted to accommodate the blast, even if we
              thought we were writing far from the blast, we were, indeed, not
              writing about the blast at all. The world had already been absurd,
              to those paying attention to the unending reported and even more
              unreported brutalities around the globe; perhaps the world is just
              more likely to look different as a multiracial child from a former
              European colony, where the scars of colonialism never fully heal,
              even if, like me, you grew up after independence. But now,
              perhaps, a new generation of writers would be unable to avoid the
              instability, the absurdity, of the post-9/11 world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe this is Murakami’s chthonic insight: that the dark
              underground, where the bad things wait—be it the underground of
              the mind, or the Underground he wrote of in 1997 in his account of
              the 1995 Tokyo Subway sarin gas attack by terrorists from Aum
              Shinrikyo—is not that deep down. The underground can’t stay
              buried. Reality A and B are indeed different—but like parallel
              train tracks in his fiction, they would inevitably crash. Perhaps
              Reality A—9/11—was inevitable; had it not happened then, it would
              have happened soon enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Murakami often distanced himself from established Japanese
              writers, most of all Yukio Mishima, but he shared with Mishima,
              Kawabata, Abe, and others a bringing-forth to the surface in his
              fiction of buried things—disquieting things, lurking in the
              senseless moonless nights of the self. We learn from Murakami that
              what is underground will soon become foreground, that all blasts
              may affect us, even when we don’t know, or want to believe, they
              have happened. We learn from Murakami that the world is indeed a
              hard-boiled wonderland, while hoping it isn’t also the end of the
              world.
